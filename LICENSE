## 🧾 Short Submission Blurb (English — paste into the form)

> **DLMM Playground** — A small Devnet UI to explore DLMM liquidity bins on Solana. It supports Phantom connect, live SOL/USDC price, Light/Dark theme, 
and a clean bins histogram. When DLMM upstream is unavailable, we fall back to a demo dataset so the interface never breaks. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, recharts, and Solana wallet adapter.  
> **Live:** https://www.laycryp.com — **Repo:** https://github.com/Laycryp/dlmm-playground
